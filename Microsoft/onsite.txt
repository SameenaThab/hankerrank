the other question was we get 2 strings a and b determine if anagram of b exists in a.
last question was a graph question that I actually messed up, it was a backtracking. you have a 5x5 grid and you want to go from 0,0 to 4,4 but you cannot pass the same edge twice and everytime you move right you have to pay 2 every time you move left your cost is decreased by 2 everytime you go up it douples the cost and everytime you go down if halves it. go to 4,4 in a way that total cost is 0 at the end.
you have to solve this for a situation that you are already moved right twice and cost is 4 already
