When I was in bachelors it helped me connect with my long lost friends from my school! when I was pursing masters, it helped me make new connections with people from my college before and after I landed here. I helped me keep my connection with my family who are not at all tech savvy but know only how to use WhatsApp.
Apart from that, I use and love Facebook open sourced projects like React, pytorch etc which makes me thing that it has strong engineering culture

What are expectations for a rotational engineer?
show in 4 mnths  for high functional E4 level. Let Manager know that you want to graduate early that will effect the project you receive
Find people to who can help you with complexity

During evaluation, what are the that I would be evaluated against?
lines of codes
no of diffs you commit
how fast you to write 
find a E4 engineer and and keep as ur benchmark. in terms of above tp know how you are doing

Is there any other suggestion you have based on your experience?
select somthing which is not radical diff from what you do
if no java available , chose someting you can learn easily
impact does not matter in rotational, 
less impact teams:
internal tools - iteration is faster, but less impact - lets you move faster, and graduate
impact team - not imp but added chery on top 
impact team - more time, more complicated

two imp roles  - manager(makes the report) and mentor(lets ur manger know abt performance)
mentor - let him know your ideas technical
manager - whom to ask what non technical

If there is something , I am struggling with in the work. Can I take help and ask doubts?
bootcamp tells you how to ask questions
mentor - dont ask too much. if you spending > 2 hrs ask some one your mentor or other team mate
ask bootcamp people (technical)
dont hesitate to ask - not getting things done and not asking question is much worse

Hm aisa mujhe 3 years hai visa po

regeret - locked in this 
You can chose a team .inisit on it
